# IMAGE_CAPTIONING

Let's imagine one day while going to market you get to see a blind man finding it difficult to cross the road crowded with people and vechiles. How you will help that person in this situation. One way to help is to first ask his permission, make him hold your arm and then help him to cross the road. But is it permanent solution? What about the situation if heis not enough comfortable to accept your help and hold your arm? Or what if there is no one around him to offer such help?

One of the possible permanent solution is of "automated guiding system", which is under research and development. This system in near future will take input of a captured video from eye-wear or head-gear used by blind people and will give a decription about ongoing activities in that video in form of text format captions which will then be converted to audio format. 

But before contributing any idea to this ongoing research we have to first understand the concept of "automated image captioning system". This is important to understand because generating captions for images quickly, accurately and in cost efficient manner will lead towards an efficient "automated guiding system" (which will work on input of captured video,i.e series of time-framed images).
